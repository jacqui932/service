        <p>Dear ${name},</p>
        <p>
            The Desmond Flockhart Trophy, which was postponed on Sunday due to the snow, has been rescheduled for Sunday 11th February 2018. The venue is still the Bridge Centre at Welwyn Garden City.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are contacting you because you had entered one or more teams for this event. We very much hope that your team(s) would like to play in the rescheduled event, though we understand it's possible that not everyone will be available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please could you let us know whether you would like to re-enter your team(s) for the February event (perhaps with some changes to the players). If you don't wish to re-enter we will refund the entry fee that you had paid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course we would also be delighted to receive entries from additional teams! New entries can be made using <a href="http://herts.bridgeentry.com/#/event/9">the form available here</a>.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Best wishes,
        </p>
        <p>

            HBA Tournament Secretary
